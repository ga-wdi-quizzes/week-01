## HTML

### Question #1

What does it mean for an HTML tag to be "semantic"? Give an example of a short snippet of HTML written using semantic tags and non-semantic tags.

```text
HTML tags should be semantic in the sense that they should serve some purpose related to the content of the page, as opposed to the styling.
bad: <b>this is just bold</b>
better: <strong>this is actually important vis a vis the content and can be styled elsewhere</strong>
```

### Question #2

What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute? e.g:

```html
<img src='https://jesse.sh/img/me.jpg' alt='Jesse Shawl'/>
```

```text
The alt attribute contains text that displays a) if the browser fails to load the image or b) for visually disabled users that have the page read to them.
```

### Question #3

What is the purpose of the `<head></head>` tag in HTML?

```text
The head tag contains the title of the HTML page, as well as linkages to any stylesheets or scripts.
```

## CSS

### Question #4

In the spaces below, write the CSS property that best matches the given description.

The choices are `border`, `outline`, `padding`, and `margin`. You will leave two spaces blank.

Your Answer:

```text
margin: Defines the distance between an element's border and adjacent elements' borders.
border: Inserts a "wall" around an element.
padding: Defines the distance between an element's content and its border.
___: Defines the width of an element.
outline: Overlays a "wall" on top of an element.
___: Defines the distance between the center of an element and the center of the adjacent element.
```

### Question #5

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[X] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, as well as the children elements that are li's
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

### Question #6

Identify the three places CSS can go, and rank them in terms of specificity:

```text
1. in-line
2. in the HTML head
3. in a separate stylesheet
```

## Git

### Question #7

Which of the following represents a correct workflow for submitting a PR on a non-master branch?
(ignore the lack of commit messages)

Select 1:
```
[X] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <ga_dc_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] git clone <ga_dc_url>; git branch <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git pull; create pull request
```

### Question 8

What is the difference between a fork and a clone?

```text
A fork creates a Github copy of an online repo; a clone is a copy of a repo downloaded onto a local drive.
```

### Question 9

How is `git pull` related to `git fetch`?

```text
Git pull combines git fetch and git merge. Git fetch is the first step--downloading any new commits--but the changes are not automatically merged (unlike a git pull).
```
