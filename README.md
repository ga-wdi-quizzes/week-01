## HTML

### Question #1

What does it mean for an HTML tag to be "semantic"? Give an example of a short snippet of HTML written using semantic tags and non-semantic tags.

```text
For an HTML tag to be semantic means that the tag itself represents the meaning of its name. For example, the <section> tag defines a particular section of the HTML content.

<section>
  <p>This is a paragraph written in a section of my webpage.</p>
</section>

A non-semantic tag is a tag that doesn't really tell what it means. It would look like this:
<p>The phrase is <b>thick and bold</b> but I wouldn't know what the letter 'b' actually means.

```

### Question #2
