## HTML

### Question #1

What does it mean for an HTML tag to be "semantic"? Give an example of a short snippet of HTML written using semantic tags and non-semantic tags.

#### Answer

A semantic HTML tag describes its meaning in a webpage; on the other hand, a non-semantic HTML tag merely defines how it looks.

Examples of semantic tags:

```html
<header>
  Masatoshi's blog
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    This is an awesome section.
  </section>
</main>
<aside>
  This can be a sidebar.
</aside>
<footer>
  Copyright 2016 Masatoshi
</footer>
```

Examples of non-semantic tags:

```html
<div>Kono <i>tagu</i> wa <b>nan no imi mo motanai</b></div>
<span>This is just a span without any semantic value.</span>
```

### Question #2

What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute? e.g:

```html
<img src='https://jesse.sh/img/me.jpg' alt='Jesse Shawl'/>
```

#### Answer

The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image in case that a user for some reason cannot view it.

Also it is used by screen readers, which visually impaired people use to hear what is on the image.

For example, if internet connection is slow and the image has not been loaded, the alternative text "Jesse Shawl" will be displayed instead. If the user uses a screen reader, the screen reader will read aloud the alternative text.
