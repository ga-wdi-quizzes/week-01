## HTML

### Question #1

What does it mean for an HTML tag to be "semantic"? Give an example of a short snippet of HTML written using semantic tags and non-semantic tags.

```text

A semantic tag clearly describes the meaning of the information that follows it.

An HTML snippet with a semantic tag would be: <em>The New York Times</em>

And an example of a non-semantic tag: <i>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>

```

### Question #2

What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute? e.g:

```html
<img src='https://jesse.sh/img/me.jpg' alt='Jesse Shawl'/>
```

```text
It's read by screen readers to make non-textual information like photos available to those who are blind. It also provides a description to images that can be read by search engines.
```

### Question #3

What is the purpose of the `<head></head>` tag in HTML?


```text
It contains the metadata on the page, including the title, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.
```

## CSS

### Question #4

In the spaces below, write the CSS property that best matches the given description.

The choices are `border`, `outline`, `padding`, and `margin`. You will leave two spaces blank.

Your Answer:

```text
margin: Defines the distance between an element's border and adjacent elements' borders.
outline: Inserts a "wall" around an element.
padding: Defines the distance between an element's content and its border.
___: Defines the width of an element.
border: Overlays a "wall" on top of an element.
___: Defines the distance between the center of an element and the center of the adjacent element.
```

### Question #5

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[X] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, as well as the children elements that are li's
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

### Question #6

Identify the three places CSS can go, and rank them in terms of specificity:

```text
1. In an external linked style sheet
2. Internally in the head of an html doc
3. In-line
```

## Git

### Question #7

Which of the following represents a correct workflow for submitting a PR on a non-master branch?
(ignore the lack of commit messages)

Select 1:
```
[X] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <ga_dc_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] git clone <ga_dc_url>; git branch <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git pull; create pull request
```

### Question 8

What is the difference between a fork and a clone?

```text
A fork copies a remote repo on GitHub into your repositories, and a clone pulls down a remote repo and links it to your local machine.
```

### Question 9

How is `git pull` related to `git fetch`?

```text
git fetch downloads all updated code from a remote repository, but it doesn't merge with your local code â€“ to do that, you need to do a git pull, which is a combination of git fetch and a git merge.
```
