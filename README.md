## HTML

### Question #1

What does it mean for an HTML tag to be "semantic"? Give an example of a short snippet of HTML written using semantic tags and non-semantic tags.

```text
An HTML tag is semantic when it is descriptive of that content's function on the page.

NON semantic:
<div class="large-text">Page Heading</div>

Semantic:
<div class="header">Page Heading</div>
```

### Question #2

What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute? e.g:

```html
<img src='https://jesse.sh/img/me.jpg' alt='Jesse Shawl'/>
```

```text
The alt attribute displays alternate text for an image if the image can't be displayed for some reason.
```

### Question #3

What is the purpose of the `<head></head>` tag in HTML?

```text
The head tag provides metadata about a web page (charset, links, title, etc.).
```

## CSS

### Question #4

In the spaces below, write the CSS property that best matches the given description.

The choices are `border`, `outline`, `padding`, and `margin`. You will leave two spaces blank.

Your Answer:

```text
margin: Defines the distance between an element's border and adjacent elements' borders.
border: Inserts a "wall" around an element.
padding: Defines the distance between an element's content and its border.
___: Defines the width of an element.
outline: Overlays a "wall" on top of an element.
___: Defines the distance between the center of an element and the center of the adjacent element.
```

### Question #5

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[X] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, as well as the children elements that are li's
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

### Question #6

Identify the three places CSS can go, and rank them in terms of specificity:

```text
1. In a separate file (eg. style.css)
2. Between <style></style> tags in the html file
3. Inline (eg. <p style="color:red;">)
```

## Git

### Question #7

Which of the following represents a correct workflow for submitting a PR on a non-master branch?
(ignore the lack of commit messages)

Select 1:
```
[X] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <ga_dc_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] git clone <ga_dc_url>; git branch <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git pull; create pull request
```

### Question 8

What is the difference between a fork and a clone?

```text
A fork creates a remote copy of a repo on your github profile.
A clone creates a local copy of a remote repo.
```

### Question 9

How is `git pull` related to `git fetch`?

```text
git fetch will download commits from the remote repo and store them in your local repo.
git pull will download commits from the remote repo and merge them into your current branch.
```
