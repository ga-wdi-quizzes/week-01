### Question #1

What does it mean for an HTML tag to be "semantic"? Give an example of a short snippet of HTML written using semantic tags and non-semantic tags.

```text
Semantic, or 'meaning', in an HTML tag specifies those tags that clearly describe their purpose or meaning. Examples of semantic tags are <img> or <table>, which clearly specify the purpose of the tag, whereas <div> and <span. do not.
```

### Question #2

What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute? e.g:

```html
<img src='https://jesse.sh/img/me.jpg' alt='Jesse Shawl'/>
```

```text
As a convention of accessibility, to describe or explain the content for alternatively-abled individuals, such as those with limited vision who could not otherwise view the text or image presented on the webpage.
```

### Question #3

What is the purpose of the `<head></head>` tag in HTML?

```text
as a placemarker for defining the scripts, meta tags, styles and so on.
```

## CSS

### Question #4

In the spaces below, write the CSS property that best matches the given description.

The choices are `border`, `outline`, `padding`, and `margin`. You will leave two spaces blank.

Your Answer:

```text
margin: Defines the distance between an element's border and adjacent elements' borders.
border: Inserts a "wall" around an element.
padding: Defines the distance between an element's content and its border.
___: Defines the width of an element.
outline: Overlays a "wall" on top of an element.
___: Defines the distance between the center of an element and the center of the adjacent element.
```

### Question #5

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, as well as the children elements that are li's
[x] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

### Question #6

Identify the three places CSS can go, and rank them in terms of specificity:

```text
1. Inline (not preferred), within the particular HTML markup element
2. Internal (better than inline but not preferred) within the head section, in style tags
3. External Style Sheets (preferred), linked to the HTML
```

## Git

### Question #7

Which of the following represents a correct workflow for submitting a PR on a non-master branch?
(ignore the lack of commit messages)

Select 1:
```
[x] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <ga_dc_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] git clone <ga_dc_url>; git branch <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git pull; create pull request
```

### Question 8

What is the difference between a fork and a clone?

```text
A fork you make your own copy of a repository to your github which you can also clone and work on or edit, a clone does not crete a personal copy to your repository.
```

### Question 9

How is `git pull` related to `git fetch`?

```text
You can request a git pull, whereby ‘git pull’ brings the changes you have made in your remote repository to where you keep your code. Git fetch brings your local copy of your remote repository up to date.
```
