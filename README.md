## HTML

### Question #1

What does it mean for an HTML tag to be "semantic"? Give an example of a short snippet of HTML written using semantic tags and non-semantic tags.

```text
For an HTML tag to be semantic means that the tag itself represents the meaning of its name. For example, the <section> tag defines a particular section of the HTML content.

<section>
  <p>This is a paragraph written in a section of my webpage.</p>
</section>

A non-semantic tag is a tag that doesn't really tell what it means. It would look like this:
<p>The phrase is <b>thick and bold</b> but I wouldn't know what the letter 'b' actually means.

```

### Question #2

What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute? e.g:

```html
<img src='https://jesse.sh/img/me.jpg' alt='Jesse Shawl'/>
```

```text
The 'alt' attribute provides an alternative text to any image that can't be displayed on the page. It is required.
```

### Question #3

What is the purpose of the `<head></head>` tag in HTML?

```text
The head tag is a container for all the elements that do not appear on the webpage when it is loaded.
```

## CSS

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[x] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
