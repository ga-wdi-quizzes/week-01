## HTML

### Question #1

What does it mean for an HTML tag to be "semantic"? Give an example of a short snippet of HTML written using semantic tags and non-semantic tags.

```text
Your answer here.

Semantic tags introduce meaning to the web page, some examples of semantic tags include the <p> and <h1> tags. On the other hand, non-semantic tags only show how a site should be styled, such as the <b> and <i> tag.
```

### Question #2

What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute? e.g:

```html
<img src='https://jesse.sh/img/me.jpg' alt='Jesse Shawl'/>
```

```text
The 'alt' attribute displays text in place of an image if the image doesn't appear. The 'alt' attribute can also help blind people know what images are used on your site by reading the 'alt' tag description out loud.

```

### Question #3

What is the purpose of the `<head></head>` tag in HTML?

```text
The <head> tag is used to store the title, styles, meta information and scripts of your web page. Anything you place in the <head> tag can not actually be seen on your page.
```

## CSS

### Question #4

In the spaces below, write the CSS property that best matches the given description.

The choices are `border`, `outline`, `padding`, and `margin`. You will leave two spaces blank.

Your Answer:

```text
margin: Defines the distance between an element's border and adjacent elements' borders.
border: Inserts a "wall" around an element.
padding: Defines the distance between an element's content and its border.
___: Defines the width of an element.
outline: Overlays a "wall" on top of an element.
___: Defines the distance between the center of an element and the center of the adjacent element.
```

### Question #5

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[x] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, as well as the children elements that are li's
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

### Question #6

Identify the three places CSS can go, and rank them in terms of specificity:

```text
1. inline style - most specific
2. internal style - second most specific
3. external - third
```

## Git

### Question #7

Which of the following represents a correct workflow for submitting a PR on a non-master branch?
(ignore the lack of commit messages)

Select 1:
```
[x] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <ga_dc_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] git clone <ga_dc_url>; git branch <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git pull; create pull request
```

### Question 8

What is the difference between a fork and a clone?

```text
When you fork something, it only clones it on the server side. When you clone a repository locally, you can't contribute back to the upstream repository unless you become a contributor.
```

### Question 9

How is `git pull` related to `git fetch`?

```text
Git pull will automatically merge all of your branches by fetching them. Git fetch gathers all of your commits and stores them locally.
```
