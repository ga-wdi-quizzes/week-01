## HTML

### Question #1

What does it mean for an HTML tag to be "semantic"? Give an example of a short snippet of HTML written using semantic tags and non-semantic tags.

```text
Semantic tags clear describe the content of the tag.
Examples of semantic tags would be <table></table> which is used to create a table and <img> which is used to display an image.
A non-semantic tag such as <div></div> don't describe the content of the tag at all, and can be used for generic purposes such as acting as a container for a collection of elements that need to have a specific style applied.
```
```text
Semantic tag example:
```
```html
<img src="Wendy-Bite.jpg" alt="This is Wendy Bite" />
```
```text
Non-Semantic tag example:
````
```html
<div>What does this container do?  Whithout looking at the css, Who knows!?</div>
````
